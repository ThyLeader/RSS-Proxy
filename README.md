# RSS-Proxy
A simple webserver in Go that can proxy RSS requests through an easy to use API without sacrificing performance. 


# Installation and Usage
It is very simple to setup. 
1. Download and install [Go](https://golang.org/) or grab a compiled binary from Thy.  
2. Clone this repository
3. `cd` into the folder the repo was cloned to
4. Run `go build` to compile a binary for your operating system
5. Type `./RSS-Proxy` or run it through your favorite process manager like so: `pm2 start ./RSS-Proxy`
6. The program will indicate when it is ready to serve requests, and you're off to the races!

If you grabbed a compiled binary from Thy, you only need to do step 5
